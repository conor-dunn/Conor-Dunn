# Hello, I'm Conor Dunn
</center>

I am currently a third year undergraduate student majoring in Geography at the University of California Santa Barbara. I have always had an interest in the environment and sustainablility which has led me to my current studies. I am also a part of the university's division one men's volleyball team which has taught me about the importance of time management and leadership.
